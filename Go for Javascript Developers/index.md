## Differences between Go and JS

Go is strongly typed: Stringg, Float, Int, Byte, Strruct...
Javascript is Dynamically typed: Think Typescript

In terms of structures, Go has structs, pointers, methods, interfaces, and define behavior and attributes
JS has ES6 classes (kind of), define behavior and attributes

Error handling
Go is explicit, sad path won't handle itself
Javascript Built in, we'll get yelled at regardless

Multitasking
Go -> Multithreaded, concurrrency, goroutines, sync
Js -> Single-threaded, callbacks, async await, sagas, sadness
