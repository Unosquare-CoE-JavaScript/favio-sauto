Typescript is a superset to Javascript, basically a programming language which actually builds up on Javascript, it takes Javascript to the next level. With Typescript (TS) we can write less error prone, better and cleaner code.

TypeScript takes the JavaScript language and adds new features and advantages to it.

The disadvantage of typescript is that it can't be executed by JavaScript environments like the browsers or and environment like node or deno.

TS is a powerful compiler which we run over our code to compile our typescript code to JS.

The TS compiler compiles these new features to JavaScript workarounds. It gives us a nicer syntax and easier ways of doing something.

More than anything TS is a developer tool not the end goal.

## TypeScript Overview

TypeScript adds:

- Types
- Next-gen Javascript features (compiled down for older browsers)
- Non-javascript features like interfaces or generics
- Rich Configuration Options
- Modern Tooling that helps even in non-typescript projects
